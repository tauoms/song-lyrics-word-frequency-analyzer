There is an incredulousness
That accompanies my depressed existence
It asks how on earth I am getting through this
So how on earth am I getting through this?
The question repeats and repeats
I stare blankly in disbelief
How am I standing?
How am I alive?
How am I making it seem like it's fine?
The question repeats and repeats

Staring blankly in disbelief
At pictures of me
And I wonder, who is this?

I don't recognise that smile
How is it so convincing?
I don't recognisе that life
Inside it feels like I am dying
It's wеird to know I wasn't happy
That's just how I made it seem
An illusion of positivity

I will never live up to these lies
I will never be worth your time

I don't feel joy
I just fake it
I don't feel hope
I just fake it
I don't feel love
I just fake it
I don't feel real
Nothing is sacred
I don't feel joy
I just fake it
I don't feel hope
I just fake it
I don't feel love
I just fake it
I don't feel real
I just fake it
I don't feel joy
I just fake it
I don't feel hope
I just fake it
I don't feel love
I just fake it
Nothing is sacred
